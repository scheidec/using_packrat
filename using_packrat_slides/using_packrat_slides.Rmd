# What is `packrat` and why would you want to use it?

## What is `packrat`?

- Packrat is a dependency management system for R

    1. Reproducible 
        - records exact package versions
        
    2. Isolated
        - installing new or updated package from one project won't break your other projects and vice versa
        
    3. Portable
        - can easily transport projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    
## Reproducibility
  
- Packrat helps solve this problem by:
    - Ensuring package sources are stored alongside your project
    - Tracking package versions

## Isolation

- Without packrat, when you install an R package, it gets installed into a global library

    - This can be problematic if you have older projects that depend on older versions of packages
  
        - i.e. a project depends on older versions of dplyr, but you want to use newer versions of dplyr
    
&nbsp;    
    
- Packrat gives each project its own private packrat library

    - if you use packrat to manage an R project, it will tell R to use and load packages from the project's _private_ packrat library instead of the global library
  
    - When you use `install.packages()` the packages will install to the _private_ _packrat_ _library_ if the project is managed by packrat
  
    - Analogy: R packages are like "books"; they live in a "library" and hence you check them out with the `library()` function


## Portability

- If you are working with collaborators/clients, you can ensure that everyone working on a Packrat project is using the same version of any R packages that your project depends on.


# How to use packrat in RStudio

## Using packrat

- Two key components: 
    - Snapshot of your project's R dependencies
    - The private packrat library powering your project
  
- Two key verbs for interacting with these components:
    - `packrat::snapshot()`
        - records the package versions used by the project and downloads their source code for storage with the project
    - `packrat::restore()`
        - applies the previous snapshot to a directory
        - use when you first open a packrat project (that someone else started) to install all of the needed packages
        - use in case you accidentally remove a package that is needed for the project

## Overview

## `packrat::snapshot()`

- Automatic snapshots option will record package upgrades and additions in the background


## `packrat::restore()`

- Applies the most recent snapshot to the project's private library
- works by adding, removing, and changing packages so that the set of installed packages and their versions matches the snapshot exactly

- Three common use cases for `packrat::restore()`:
    - Hydrate - use `restore()` after copying a project to a new machine to populate the library on that machine
    - Sync - Use `restore()` to apply library changes made by a collaborator to your own library (In general, you want to run `restore()` whenever you pick up a change to `packrat.lock`)
    - Rollback - use `restore()` to undo accidental changes 

## `packrat::clean()`

- Removes packages from the library that are installed but not needed for your project
      
## `packrat::status()`

- Shows the differences between the project's packrat dependencies, its private package library, and its R scripts


## Moving in and out of packrat mode

- `packrat::off()`
    - Gets out of packrat mode, i.e. if you want to use stuff in your global library
  
- `packrat::on()`
    - Gets back into packrat mode
  
  
## Miscellaneous

- All base R packages are already installed and versioned in the private packrat library when you set up packrat in your project
    - in `lib-R` directory
    - All loaded packages go into the `lib` directory
  
- Use `packrat::init()` to set up packrat in an existing project
    
    
# Using `packrat` in our repositories

## Packrat with RStudio Projects

- One `.Rproj` in top level directory, or multiple nested `.Rproj`'s in each subdirectory?
    - There are pros and cons to each
    

# How to hand off a `packrat` project to a client

## Collaboration with packrat

- `packrat::bundle()`
    - Bundles the entire project into a gzipped tarball (`.tar.gz`) file to share with collaborators/clients
  
- `packrat::unbundle()`
    - Unbundles the `.tar.gz` file into a new directory on the collaborator/client's machine in the exact same version as the project was bundled, with the same versions of packages and dependencies installed
    - This automatically happens when the collaborator unzips/opens the `.tar.gz` file and opens the `.Rproj` file on their machine for the first time
